Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
The Observer pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to and from these events for any object that implements a subscriber interface.

Usage of the pattern in Java
Complexity: medium
Popularity: high

Usage examples:
The Observer pattern is pretty common in Java code, especially in the GUI components. It provides a way to react to events happening in other objects without coupling to their classes.

Here are some examples of the pattern in core Java libraries:
-> java.util.Observer/java.util.Observable (rarely used in real world)
-> All implementations of java.util.EventListener (practically all over Swing components)
-> javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener
-> javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener
-> javax.faces.event.PhaseListener

Identification:
The pattern can be recognized if you see a subscription method that stores incoming objects in a list.
You can confirm the identification, if you see some sort of notification method that iterates over objects in that list and calls their “update” method.

Code example: Event subscription
In this example, the Observer pattern establishes indirect collaboration between objects of a text editor.
Each time the Editor object changes, it notifies its subscribers. EmailNotificationListener and LogOpenListener react to these notifications by executing their primary behaviors.
Subscriber classes aren’t coupled to the editor class and can be reused in other apps if needed.
The Editor class depends only on the abstract subscriber interface. This allows adding new subscriber types without changing the editor’s code.
